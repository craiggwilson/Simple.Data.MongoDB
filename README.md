Simple.Data.MongoDB
===================

This is the mongodb adapter for the [Simple.Data](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data) library. For examples on its usage, see the core site as the syntax is exactly the same.  Any departures from that syntax will be documented in the wiki.

This library is available via [nuget](http://www.nuget.org).
